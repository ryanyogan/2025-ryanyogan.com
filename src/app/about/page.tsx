            Embarking on my tech journey with a 386 computer, I quickly became
            the family IT department, graduating from building PCs to conjuring
            AOL &quot;proggies&quot; in Visual Basic. My love affair with server
            racks in chilly rooms was just the beginning, and my entry into
            theater! Fast forward through a symphony of C#, PHP spells, and
            Rails-powered rollercoasters, and you&apos;ll find me professing my
            love for all things engineering.

            These days, I&apos;m crafting video game masterpieces in Rust—so
            &quot;unique&quot; they&apos;re practically art, and hoarding
            leadership books like they&apos;re going out of style. My toolkit? A
            kaleidoscope of TypeScript frameworks so infamous, they dare not
            speak their names.

          <p className="font-sans text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-400 tracking-tight">
            I&apos;ve navigated the startup scene from a cozy nook above a
            Chicago bar to the dizzying heights of corporate skyscrapers, and I
            love them all. Amidst a quirky relationship with Emacs and Clojure
            (we&apos;re complicated), I find Zen in configuring Neovim more than
            I do in housekeeping. I occasionally pine for the days of wrestling
            with ColdFusion, Perl, and coaxing that last table and gif into
            pixel-perfect harmony for IE6—ah, simpler times.

            My home doubles as an aircraft hangar, thanks to an obsession with
            tinkering on aircrafts and simulators. I&apos;ve taken &quot;home
            office&quot; to new altitudes, recreating a commercial flight
            experience that&apos;s just one cranky passenger short of actual
            takeoff.
