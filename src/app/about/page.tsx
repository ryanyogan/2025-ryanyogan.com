          Hello I&apos;m Ryan,

          distributed services, and nurturing a dynamic 🤝 team development.

          My engineering approach is that of a Technical Generalist, recognizing
          the unique value each technology brings to the table. My mission is to
          build and teach, leveraging my broad skill set to innovate and 💡
          inspire.

          I made a new site, with my own design for once lmao. I put some
          serious thought into the spacing, fonts, and simplicity. I want to
          write more, I cannot stand my voice on YouTube. I may ramble about
          leadership, engineering, life, aviation... why not, my parents are a
          majority of my traffic, hi mom 👋.
        </p>

          Okay, here&apos;s what LLM&apos;s have to say about me...
        </h2>

        <p className="text-base text-gray-700 tracking-tighter">
          Embarking on my tech journey with a 386 computer, I quickly became the
          family IT department, graduating from building PCs to conjuring AOL
          &quot;proggies&quot; in Visual Basic. My love affair with server racks
          in chilly rooms was just the beginning, and my entry into theater!
          Fast forward through a symphony of C#, PHP spells, and Rails-powered
          rollercoasters, and you&apos;ll find me professing my love for all
          things engineering.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-700 tracking-tighter">
          These days, I&apos;m crafting video game masterpieces in Rust—so
          &quot;unique&quot; they&apos;re practically art, and hoarding
          leadership books like they&apos;re going out of style. My toolkit? A
          kaleidoscope of TypeScript frameworks so infamous, they dare not speak
          their names.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base text-gray-700 tracking-tighter">
          I&apos;ve navigated the startup scene from a cozy nook above a Chicago
          bar to the dizzying heights of corporate skyscrapers, and I love them
          all. Amidst a quirky relationship with Emacs and Clojure (we&apos;re
          complicated), I find Zen in configuring Neovim more than I do in
          housekeeping. I occasionally pine for the days of wrestling with
          ColdFusion, Perl, and coaxing that last table and gif into
          pixel-perfect harmony for IE6—ah, simpler times.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-gray-700 tracking-tighter">
          My home doubles as an aircraft hangar, thanks to an obsession with
          tinkering on aircrafts and simulators. I&apos;ve taken &quot;home
          office&quot; to new altitudes, recreating a commercial flight
          experience that&apos;s just one cranky passenger short of actual
          takeoff.
