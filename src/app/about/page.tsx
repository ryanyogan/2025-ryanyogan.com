            Chapter 1: The Surge-Fueled Prodigy
          </span>
          Most kids grow up playing with toys. I grew up playing with AOL
          proggies and breaking my dad’s computer. At 14, I wasn’t just coding—I
          was revolutionizing the concept of “grungy” websites. My first clients
          were bands that thought Comic Sans was edgy. I charged them $200 for
          masterpieces so grunge you couldn’t tell where the text ended and the
          background began. Nirvana vibes? You bet. Usable? Absolutely not. Art?
          Hell yes. That was my first taste of entrepreneurship. While other
          kids were figuring out how to sneak into R-rated movies, I was
          figuring out how to make OGG files play on Winamp competitors I coded
          from scratch. Did I know what I was doing? Nope. Did that stop me?
          Also nope.

            Chapter 2: The Data Whisperer
          </span>
          As I got older, I transitioned from breaking personal computers to
          breaking corporate ones—professionally, of course. Network operations
          was my playground, and Windows NT was my best frenemy. There’s a
          certain thrill to watching high-frequency trading systems crash and
          being the only person in the room calm enough to fix it. One time, a
          trader stormed into the server room screaming about losing millions. I
          took a long sip of my coffee, typed three lines of code, and the
          system roared back to life. He asked me how I did it, and I told him,
          “With caffeine and spite.” He didn’t laugh, but I did.

            Chapter 3: Falling in Love with Ruby (and Other Languages .. JS lol)
          </span>
          I’ve always been a sucker for a good programming language. Perl was my
          first crush, PHP was my messy rebound, and ColdFusion… well, we don’t
          talk about ColdFusion. But Ruby? Ruby was different. Ruby wasn’t just
          a language; Ruby was a lifestyle. She was elegant, she was logical,
          and she didn’t yell at me when I made a mistake. I spent countless
          nights coding with Ruby, a glass of whiskey in one hand and my
          keyboard in the other. It wasn’t just coding—it was poetry. Of course,
          I’ve dabbled in others since then: Go, Elixir, Rust, even Zig (because
          who doesn’t love a little chaos?). But Ruby? Ruby was my first true
          love.

            Chapter 4: Planes, Trains, and Debugging Automobiles
          </span>
          At some point, I decided that fixing computers wasn’t enough. I wanted
          to fix everything: data platforms, real-time systems, route planning
          for vehicles, you name it. There was this one time I convinced a room
          full of grizzled drivers that their logistics system could be as smart
          as a Boeing 737’s flight management system. They laughed—until I built
          it. Now, I don’t want to say I saved the transportation industry, but
          I will say I made a lot of drivers very happy. And if you’ve ever seen
          a truck driver smile, you know that’s no small feat.

            Chapter 5: Serverless and Sleepless
          </span>
          If you’ve never explained serverless architecture to someone who
          thinks “the cloud” is where birds live, you haven’t truly lived. I
          spent months convincing people that we could ditch half the codebase
          and still make everything run faster. It worked, of course, because
          I’m very good at what I do. The best part? I got to call up AWS
          engineers and say, “Hey, your Lambda instances are great, but what if
          they were better?” They didn’t hang up, which I think is a testament
          to my charm.

            Chapter 6: Debugging Life Outside of work
          </span>
          I’m just a guy who likes planes, cars, and breaking things so I can
          fix them again. I trained to fly real airplanes, but my eyes had other
          plans, so now I stick to simulators. I also build off-road vehicles
          because nothing says “relaxation” like tearing through mud at 40 mph.
          I’ve coded in every language you’ve heard of (and a few you haven’t),
          led teams, built systems, and occasionally yelled at TypeScript like
          it owes me money. My hobbies include finding obscure bugs, pretending
          to understand Rust, and convincing my kids that debugging is a sport.

            Epilogue: The Final Debug
          </span>
          If there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s that
          everything—systems, cars, life itself—is just one big debugging
          problem. And if you approach it with enough coffee, sarcasm, and
          stubborn determination, you can fix anything. Or at least make it look
          like it’s working. So here I am: part technologist, part tinkerer,
          part chaos coordinator. Life’s a mess, and I wouldn’t have it any
          other way.
